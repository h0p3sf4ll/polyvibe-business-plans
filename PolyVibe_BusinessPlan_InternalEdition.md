## 1. Why PolyVibe Matters

### The $47 Billion Problem We're Solving

Every 60 seconds, 175 businesses attempt to create a web presence and fail. They spend an average of **$12,000 and 8 weeks** on a process that should take **minutes and cost less than $100**. This isn't just inefficiency—it's a massive barrier to global economic participation.

**The Human Cost:**
- **4.2 million** small businesses shut down annually due to poor digital presence
- **$47 billion** wasted on failed web development projects
- **18 hours** average time business owners spend trying to update simple website content
- **67%** of consumers won't purchase from businesses with poor websites

**Why Current Solutions Fail:**
1. **Website Builders** (Wix, Squarespace): Still require 40+ hours to achieve professional results
2. **Agencies**: Average $5,000-$50,000, 6-12 week timelines, ongoing maintenance costs
3. **Freelancers**: Unreliable, inconsistent quality, average 3-week delivery
4. **DIY Coding**: Requires technical skills that 92% of business owners lack
