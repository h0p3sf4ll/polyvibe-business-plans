# PolyVibe Business Plan — Internal Leadership Edition v2 (Full Board Draft)

## Document Purpose
This document is an internal, board-level operating plan for PolyVibe. It establishes a five-year strategy (2026–2030), resourcing, governance, and the financial model required to deliver sustained growth and margin expansion. All figures are in USD MM (millions). Style is single-column corporate Markdown to support PDF or Confluence export.

## 1. Executive Overview
PolyVibe is an AI-driven, crypto-enabled platform that enables non-technical users and small businesses to build, deploy, and maintain modern web experiences in minutes. The company’s core advantage is the fusion of:
- AI-assisted build and deploy workflows (time-to-value measured in minutes);
- A modular backend with scalable inference and hosting;
- Tokenized incentives that reinforce usage, loyalty, and community-led growth.

Strategic intent over five years:
- Establish category leadership in AI × Web3 creation tools.
- Achieve sustained hypergrowth (100% revenue CAGR) with operating leverage.
- Reach 40% EBITDA margin by Year 5 with positive FCF from Year 2 onward.
- Maintain conservative treasury management and clean governance under a Wyoming DAO LLC.

## 2. Strategic Objectives (2026–2030)
1. Product Leadership: Ship V1–V5 with a secure, performant, and extensible architecture; keep “minutes-to-production” as the core north-star metric.
2. Financial Discipline: Positive free cash flow by Year 2; expand EBITDA margin from ~30% in Year 3 to ~40% by Year 5.
3. Market Penetration: Acquire, activate, and retain creators and small businesses via a disciplined funnel; compound growth with network effects.
4. Operational Maturity: Implement rigorous governance, risk management, auditability, and compliance (DAO-compatible).
5. Culture of Execution: Set quarterly OKRs; enforce clear decision rights; build leaders who scale.

## 3. Market Context and Strategic Rationale
- Buyers: small businesses, solo creators, agencies, and growth teams that need rapid web presence and AI automation.
- Pain: traditional website builders are slow to customize, lack integrated AI, and rarely provide deployment-to-domain handoff.
- Why PolyVibe wins: integrated AI build pipeline; self-serve deployment; tokenized incentives that reduce CAC and improve retention; extensible SDK and marketplace.

Key implications for operating plan:
- Prioritize time-to-value features (prompt-to-live-demo, guided revisions, one-click domain attach).
- Maintain a lean core and open extension points (SDK, templates, connectors).
- Monetize predictably (subscriptions + credits), while token design strengthens loyalty and advocacy.

---

## 4. Product and Technology Overview
- Frontend: Next.js UI with strong accessibility, guided interviews, and guardrails.
- Backend: Appwrite for auth/data/services; KrakenD for gateway; modular microservices for build, inference, deploy.
- DevSecOps: CI/CD, automated tests, SAST/DAST, image scanning, IaC controls; 99.5% uptime SLO.
- Observability: Logs, metrics, traces; golden signals dashboards for latency, errors, saturation, and traffic.
- Security: RBAC/ABAC, key management, secrets rotation, periodic pen tests, bug bounty.
- Data: Structured telemetry for cohort analytics, LTV/CAC by segment, and funnel diagnostics.

Roadmap anchors (high-level):
- V1 (2025 Q4): AI page builder + CLI + subdomain deploy.
- V2 (2026 Q1–Q2): Domain attach, billing, marketplace, creator incentives.
- V3 (2026 Q3–Q4): Mobile app generation; SDK for developers; advanced analytics.
- V4 (2027): Multi-tenant agency tooling; bulk deployment; partner APIs.
- V5 (2028+): Deconalized compute exchange for credits; advanced automation.

Narrative: Revenue scales via subscriptions, credits, and hosting. Gross margin expands as inference costs are optimized (vendor credits, model tuning, partial GPU ownership). Opex growth remains disciplined; EBITDA margin reaches ~40% by 2030.

### 6.2 Cash Flow Statement (Summary)
|  | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
|--|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| Net Income | (6) | 5 | 30 | 84 | 198 |

### 6.3 Balance Sheet Highlights
|  | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
|--|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| Cash & Equivalents | 8 | 13 | 43 | 127 | 325 |
| PP&E (net) | 2 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| Other Current Assets | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 |
| Total Assets | 10 | 16 | 45 | 130 | 330 |
| Accounts Payable | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 15 |
| Deferred Revenue | 1 | 3 | 6 | 12 | 25 |
| Taxes Payable | 0 | 1 | 3 | 7 | 20 |
| Total Liabilities | 2 | 6 | 13 | 27 | 60 |
| Shareholders’ Equity | 8 | 10 | 32 | 103 | 270 |

Narrative: Working capital scales prudently; liabilities mainly reflect payables and deferred revenue from annual prepayments. Equity growth mirrors retained earnings.

### 6.4 Break-even and Unit Economics (High Level)
- Break-even: Achieved between 2027–2028 with EBITDA turning structurally positive in 2027 and FCF strongly positive.
- Unit economics: Positive contribution after onboarding; CAC recouped within the first 2–3 months for target segments.
- Sensitivities: A 10% adverse move in inference pricing compresses gross margin ~200–300 bps; mitigated by dynamic routing and on-prem capacity.

---

## 7. Funding and Treasury Governance
- Seed: $15 raised via hybrid structure (2% tokens + 10% equity in Wyoming DAO LLC).
- Treasury policy: 12–18 months runway target; quarterly reporting; segregated reserves for taxes, compliance, and liquidity provisioning.
- Buyback & burn: 5% of quarterly profits allocated starting 2028, subject to board approval and treasury health checks.
- Risk tolerance: conservative FX/crypto exposure; hedging mandates for market-making pools.

---

## 8. Marketing and Customer Growth Plan
Objectives by phase:
- Awareness (2025–2026): credibility via Tier-1 influencers, owned media, and partner co-marketing.
- Activation (2026–2027): airdrop funnels, templates marketplace, and onboarding incentives.
- Retention (2027–2028): usage-based credits, feature education, and customer success playbooks.
- Scale (2029–2030): enterprise motion, agency channels, and international expansion.

Budget and ROI:
- Marketing spend begins near 31% of Opex (with performance multipliers) and tapers toward 20% by Year 5.
- ROI target ≥ 3× in Year 1 rising to ≥ 4× by Year 4 through cohort quality improvements.

Channel strategy:
- Influencers (contracted via vesting) for credibility and reach.
- Performance (search/social/CMCs) for demand capture.
- Community (Discord/Telegram) for retention and advocacy.
- Partnerships (registrars, payment gateways, hosts) for distribution.
