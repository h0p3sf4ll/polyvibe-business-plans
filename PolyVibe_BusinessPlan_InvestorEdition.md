# PolyVibe Business Plan — Investor Edition v2 (Board Draft)

## 1. Executive Summary and Investment Thesis
PolyVibe is an AI-driven, crypto-enabled platform that collapses the time it takes to stand up a production-grade web experience from weeks to minutes. The platform’s core proposition—“prompt to production”—creates a large, defensible market opportunity at the intersection of AI productivity and tokenized participation.

Launch capitalization and structure:
- Token: $VIBE, total supply 500MM, launch price $1.00, FDV $500MM.
- Initial float: 10% (50MM tokens; ~$50MM initial liquidity target with exchange support).
- Seed: $15MM hybrid (2% tokens + 10% equity in Wyoming DAO LLC).

Return logic for investors:
- Topline growth doubles annually over five years (hyper-scaling supported by liquidity and product expansion).
- EBITDA margin expands to ~40% by Year 5 via operating leverage and cost optimization.
- Quarterly buyback/burn (5% of profits) enhances price stability and long-term value per token.

## 2. Market Opportunity and Strategic Rationale
- Target users: small businesses, creators, agencies needing fast, flexible web presence and AI automation.
- Problem: Current builders lack integrated AI workflows, slow deployment-to-domain handoff, and cohesive monetization tooling.
- Opportunity size: multi-billion market across no-code, AI inference, hosting, and domain services.
- Competitive advantage: integrated AI → deploy pipeline; tokenized incentives; marketplace and SDK extensibility; disciplined governance.

---

## 3. Product and Technology Overview
- AI creation workflow: guided interview, generation, preview, revise, deploy.
- Architecture: Next.js UI; Appwrite services; KrakenD gateway; modular microservices; observability and security baked in.
- Compliance and security: CI/CD with SAST/DAST, container scanning; RBAC/ABAC; periodic pen tests; incident response.
- Roadmap: V1 (builder + deploy); V2 (marketplace + domain attach); V3 (mobile apps + SDK); V4 (agency tooling); V5 (decentralized compute credits).

---

## 4. Investment Plan and Use of Proceeds
Seed raise ($15MM) hybrid structure (2% tokens + 10% equity) to accelerate product readiness, liquidity, and demand generation.

Use of funds:
- Infrastructure & GPU CapEx — 35% ($5.25MM): inference optimization and scaling.
- Marketing & Growth — 30% ($4.50MM): Tier-1 influencers, performance channels, exchange marketing.
- Operations & Payroll — 15% ($2.25MM): engineering, product, growth, support.
- Legal & Compliance — 10% ($1.50MM): DAO, audits, exchange compliance.
- Treasury Reserve — 10% ($1.50MM): volatility and strategic flexibility.

Investor protections:
- Governance: Wyoming DAO LLC with weighted voting (Founders 50%, Investors 25%, Community 25%).
- Reporting: quarterly transparency on treasury, runway, and risk.
- Liquidity: multi-exchange strategy; treasury-backed liquidity pools.

## 5. Five-Year Financial Plan (USD MM, High-Level)
Assumptions: revenue doubles annually; COGS efficiencies; marketing taper; EBITDA margin expansion to ~40% by Year 5; 21% tax; controlled CapEx.

### 5.1 Income Statement (Summary)
|  | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
|--|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| Revenue | $36 | $90 | $180 | $360 | $720 |
| Gross Profit | $13 | $41 | $90 | $198 | $396 |
| EBITDA | $(5) | $7 | $39 | $108 | $252 |
| Net Income | $(6) | $5 | $30 | $84 | $198 |

Narrative: Rapid growth at improving gross margins (vendor credits, optimization, partial ownership of GPU capacity). Opex growth remains disciplined, yielding strong EBITDA and net income trajectory from Year 2 onward.

### 5.2 Cash Flow (Summary)
|  | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
|--|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| Free Cash Flow | $(8) | $5 | $30 | $84 | $198 |
| Ending Cash Balance | $8 | $13 | $43 | $127 | $325 |

Narrative: Free cash flow positive in Year 2 with meaningful cash accumulation by Year 5 to support buybacks, listings, and selective acquisitions.

### 5.3 Valuation and IRR Sensitivity
Token price and market cap trajectory (illustrative):
- Base: $1.00 → $3.00 → $5.00 → $8.00 → $10.00 (Y1–Y5)
- FDV trajectory: $500MM → $1.5B → $2.5B → $4.0B → $5.0B

IRR sensitivity on a representative investor position (illustrative, assumes proportional token exposure and no leverage):

| Scenario | Y1 Price | Y3 Price | Y5 Price | 5-Year IRR (approx.) |
|----------|---------:|---------:|---------:|----------------------:|
| Bear | $0.85 | $2.00 | $3.50 | 18–22% |
| Base | $1.00 | $5.00 | $10.00 | 35–40% |
| Bull | $1.25 | $7.00 | $15.00 | 50%+ |

Narrative: Returns are driven by utility adoption, liquidity depth, and buyback/burn. Risk controls include treasury-backed liquidity, diversified listings, and conservative runway management.
